# Sensor Setup

The most thorough documentation for sensor setup is provided by Texas Instruments [here](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore/node?node=A__AONFBQevesFfseDnZda2rw__com.ti.mmwave_industrial_toolbox__VLyFKFf__LATEST).

It has links to all the downloads you need/ videos you should watch to run the sensor.

Make sure you use your school email when downloading MATLAB, that way you get it for free.
