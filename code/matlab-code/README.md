# Matlab Code

If you have not fully set up the sensor, do that first and then come back.

This code is the updated version of the Area_Scanner_GUI lab provided by Texas Instruments. We have modified the code in a way that sensor data (more specifically, positional data from dynamic objects) is sent to Unity.

As far as we are aware, running the lab the way you see it in Texas Instruments' documentation does not use our updated code. You will need to run it manually within MATLAB.

To do this, you can open all the files from the Area_Scanner_GUI folder in MATLAB. Navigate to the area_scanner_visualizer.m file, and press play on the button circled in red.

You will likely have to download the ![Instrument Control Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/instrument.html), and possibly other modules that we've forgotten. Make sure you use your school email for MATLAB and also to download this module, that way it's all free.
